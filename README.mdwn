# Needle Optimization Using TFNN
## Overview
TFNN is an efficient algorithm in computing transmission matrices when simulating optical response of multi-layer structures.
We implement TFNN in needle optimization, which is a classical algorithm in designing layers with little known information of the target.

The aim of this project is 
- increase the efficiency of traditional algorithms
- search for the underlining rules determining the design results.
- find ways to realize better designs of multi-layer films.
  - lower total optical thickness
  - lower layer numbers
  - fewer "super thin" layers which is impractical in realistic manufacture.
## File structure
```
./design
    main.py
./gets
    get_spectrum.py
    get_jacobi.py
    get_insert_jacobi.py
```
`main` files implements
- LM descent
- needle insertion iterations
- multi-thread acceleration.

`gets` module contains functions returning
- reflectance/transmittance spectrums
- gradient (Jacobi matrices) for optimizing layer thickness
- gradient for insertions in needle method.

## To-do

- film class
  - instance has: refractive index of each layer at specified wl
- conceal LM and insertions into modules, making main functions more concise and reduce duplicate code.
- unit tests
