# Needle Optimization Using TFNN

## Overview

TFNN is an efficient algorithm in computing transmission matrices when simulating optical response of multi-layer thin film structures.
We implement TFNN in needle optimization, which is a classical algorithm in designing layers with little known information of the target.

The aim of this project is

- increase the efficiency of traditional algorithms
- search for the underlining rules determining the design results.
- find ways to realize better designs of multi-layer films.
  - lower total optical thickness
  - lower layer numbers
  - fewer "too thin" layers which is impractical in realistic manufacture.
## Usage
To get started with the Thin-Film-Design library, follow these steps:

1. Import the required classes and functions from the library:
  ```
  from optimizer import Optimizer, AdamOptimizer
  from spectrum import BaseSpectrum
  from film import FreeFormFilm, TwoMaterialFilm
  ```
2. Define your thin film stack structure and target spectra:
  ```
  film = FreeFormFilm(...)
  target_spec_ls = [BaseSpectrum(...), ...]
  ```

3. Initialize an optimizer with the film and target spectra:
  ```
  optimizer = AdamOptimizer(film, target_spec_ls, max_steps=...)
  ```
4. Run the optimization processï¼š
  ```
  optimizer.optimize()
  ```
## Dependencies

Run on a machine supporting CUDA

- numpy
- numba
- cudatoolkit
- matplotlib

Use `conda create -n TFNN python=3.9 ipykernel scipy numpy=1.23 numba=0.56.4 matplotlib cudatoolkit=*the cuda version of the driver* -c conda-forge` or `conda env create --file=environments.yml`. 

Note that the version of cudatoolkit should match that of the version of the driver, which can be found by the tool `nvidia-smi`

> It works out of the box for CUDA C/C++ as far as I am aware - however, because Numba doesn't know anything about forward compatibility it always tries to generate PTX for the latest version supported by the toolkit and not the driver, so the driver refuses to accept it for linking [Thread](https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/7006)
